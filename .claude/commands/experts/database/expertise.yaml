# Database Expert - Expertise Template
# This file serves as your mental model for database-related functionality
# Run /experts:database:self-improve to populate this with your codebase's database patterns

  description: "Database schema, models, and operations for this project"
  status: "Template - run /experts:database:self-improve to build expertise from your codebase"

# Add your database tables and schema here
schema_structure:
  tables: []
  # Example:
  # - name: "users"
  #   file: "migrations/001_users.sql"
  #   columns:
  #     - "id (UUID primary key)"
  #     - "email (VARCHAR unique)"
  #     - "created_at (TIMESTAMP)"

# Add your Pydantic models here
models:
  location: "TODO: Add path to your models file"
  classes: []
  # Example:
  # - name: "User"
  #   fields:
  #     - "id: UUID"
  #     - "email: str"
  #     - "created_at: datetime"

# Add your key database operations here
key_operations:
  functions: []
  # Example:
  # - name: "create_user"
  #   file: "database.py"
  #   purpose: "Create a new user record"

# Migration patterns
migrations:
  directory: "migrations/"
  pattern: "Numbered SQL files (001_xxx.sql, 002_xxx.sql)"
  runner: "Custom Python script or Alembic"

# Best practices for this codebase
best_practices:
  - "Use Pydantic models for data validation"
  - "Keep migrations idempotent (safe to run multiple times)"
  - "Use connection pooling for production"

# Key file locations
key_files:
  models: "TODO: Add path to your models file"
  database: "TODO: Add path to your database operations file"
  migrations: "TODO: Add path to your migrations directory"
