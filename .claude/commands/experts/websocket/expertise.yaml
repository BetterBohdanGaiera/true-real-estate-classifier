# WebSocket server configuration
server:
  framework: "TODO: Add framework (FastAPI, aiohttp, etc.)"
  endpoint: "/ws"
  # Example:
  # file: "backend/main.py"
  # lines: "100-150"

# Event types your system broadcasts
event_types: []
  # Example:
  # - name: "message"
  #   direction: "server -> client"
  #   fields: ["type", "content", "timestamp"]
  # - name: "user_action"
  #   direction: "client -> server"
  #   fields: ["action", "payload"]

# Connection management
connection_management:
  pattern: "TODO: Describe your connection handling pattern"
  # Example:
  # manager_class: "WebSocketManager"
  # file: "websocket_manager.py"
  # methods:
  #   - "connect: Add client to active connections"
  #   - "disconnect: Remove client from active connections"
  #   - "broadcast: Send message to all connected clients"

# Message handling
message_handlers: []
  # Example:
  # - event: "subscribe"
  #   handler: "handle_subscribe"
  #   description: "Subscribe client to specific channel"

# Broadcasting patterns
broadcasting:
  patterns: []
  # Example:
  # - name: "broadcast_to_all"
  #   description: "Send message to all connected clients"
  # - name: "broadcast_to_room"
  #   description: "Send message to clients in specific room"

# Best practices
best_practices:
  - "Handle disconnections gracefully"
  - "Use heartbeat/ping-pong for connection health"
  - "Serialize messages to JSON before sending"
  - "Validate incoming messages"
