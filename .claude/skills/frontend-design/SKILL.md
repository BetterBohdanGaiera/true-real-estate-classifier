# Frontend Design Skill

This skill specializes in creating distinctive, production-grade web interfaces that prioritize genuine design thinking over generic aesthetics. It guides developers in building components, pages, and applications across various frameworks.

## Design Principles

**Before coding**, understand context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction by considering:
- Purpose and tone of the interface
- Constraints and requirements
- How to differentiate from generic designs

## Key Focus Areas

### Typography
Move beyond default fonts toward distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics with unexpected, characterful selections paired strategically.

### Color & Theme
Build cohesive aesthetics using CSS variables, favoring dominant colors with sharp accents rather than timid distributions.

### Motion
Prioritize high-impact orchestrated moments like staggered reveals during page load over scattered interactions.

### Composition
Embrace asymmetry, overlap, and grid-breaking layouts with either generous negative space or controlled density.

### Details
Layer textures, gradients, patterns, and custom effects that match the overall aesthetic direction.

## What to Avoid

Reject "generic AI-generated aesthetics," including:
- Overused font families
- Cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds)
- Predictable layouts lacking context-specific character

## Core Philosophy

**Match implementation complexity to vision**: maximalist designs require elaborate code, while refined designs demand precision in spacing and typography.
