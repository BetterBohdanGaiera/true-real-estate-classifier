14 communication scenarios for English-speaking clients with ready-to-use scripts.

---

## Case 1: New Lead (Funnel Entry)

**Situation:** Client just entered the funnel (submitted a request on the website).

**Goal:** Establish contact, show value, begin collecting information.

**Key Elements:**
- Greeting with name
- Context (source of inquiry)
- Introduction + company value
- Open question (goal: living or investment?)

**Script:**
```
Good day, Alex!

We received your inquiry on our website regarding real estate investment in Bali.
My name is Maria, I'm an investment consultant at True Real Estate.
We specialize in investment consulting and operate according to British capital
management standards. To ensure the projects in our selection are perfectly suited
for you, may I ask a few questions?

Are you considering property in Bali for personal living or as an investment?
```

---

## Case 2: No Response (Value Follow-up)

**Situation:** Client didn't respond to the first/second message.

**Goal:** Gently remind without being pushy, maintain interest.

**2nd Message (Micro-Insight Approach):**
```
Good day, Alex! I wanted to share some fresh data from our Estate Market software
for the Canggu area — last month's actual occupancy rate in the apartment segment
was 82%. If you'd like a yield calculation based on these facts rather than
marketing brochures — let me know, I'll send the numbers.
```

**3rd Message (Care & Check-in):**
```
Good day, Alex!
How are you doing? Is everything alright?
Just to clarify for our records: is Bali real estate investment still relevant
for you, or has something changed?
```

---

## Case 3: Refused Dialogue

**Situation:** Client explicitly declined to communicate.

**Goal:** Respectfully close, leave the door open.

**Script:**
```
Good day, Alex!
Thank you for your response! We won't bother you with more messages —
we fully respect your decision.

If in the future you consider investing in Bali again,
we'd be happy to assist.

Wishing you a wonderful day and good luck with your plans!
```

## Case 4: Catalog Request

**Situation:** Client asks to "just send a catalog," doesn't want to communicate.

**Goal:** Don't release with just a catalog — collect information for personalization.

**Script:**
```
Good day, Alex!
Of course. I'll prepare for you not just a catalog, but a selection of properties
that have passed our internal 140-point audit.
To make the selection as relevant as possible, could you please tell me:

• Are you interested in a property for living or investment?
• Villa or apartment?
• Your approximate budget?
• When would you be ready to purchase if you find the ideal option?
```

**After Responses:**
```
Thank you, Alex!
To save your time, I suggest a short 20-minute Zoom call.
During the meeting, I'll show you the selection with comments on the pros
and cons of each option.
What works better for you — weekday evenings or weekends?
```

---

## Case 5: Not Ready to Buy Immediately

**Situation:** Client is interested, but purchase is planned in 1-2 months or later.

**Goal:** Show options for delayed demand (pre-sale, reservation).

**Script:**
```
I understand, Alex!
In that case, we can reserve a property in advance with delayed entry
or lock in the price during pre-sale.

Let me prepare 2-3 such options and show them during a short Zoom call.
What works better for you — weekday evenings or weekend mornings?
```

---

## Case 6: Referral

**Situation:** Client came through a friend's recommendation.

**Goal:** Thank for trust, continue standard information gathering.

**Script:**
```
Good day, Alex!
Thank you for your trust — it's always a pleasure to work with referrals.

May I ask, are you considering property for living or as an investment?
```

**Continue with standard information gathering and Zoom invitation.**

---

## Case 7: Oceanfront Interest

**Situation:** Client specifically interested in oceanfront/beachfront property.

**Goal:** Explain Bali specifics (limited oceanfront options), redirect to alternatives.

**Script:**
```
Good day, Alex!
Oceanfront properties in Bali are quite rare due to government restrictions
on coastal development. However, we have several premium options with ocean views
and 5-10 minute walk to the beach.

These properties often perform better investment-wise due to lower
maintenance costs while still offering the beach lifestyle.
Would you like me to prepare a selection of ocean-view properties
that passed our 140-point audit?
```

---

## Case 8: Not in Bali / New to Locations

**Situation:** Client has never been to Bali, doesn't know the areas.

**Goal:** Educational approach, overview of key areas, build trust.

**Script:**
```
Good day, Alex!
Perfect timing to explore Bali real estate! Let me briefly explain
the key investment areas:

• Canggu — highest rental yields, young professional crowd
• Seminyak — established area, premium segment
• Uluwatu — emerging, surf culture, strong growth potential
• Ubud — cultural center, wellness tourism

During our Zoom call, I can show you the real occupancy data from
our Estate Market software for each area.
Would weekday or weekend work better for a 20-minute overview?
```

---

## Case 9: Land Ownership Fears (Leasehold Handling)

**Situation:** Client has concerns about leasehold, land ownership for foreigners.

**Goal:** Address concerns with facts, explain legal framework.

**Script:**
```
I completely understand your concerns, Alex — this is the most common question
we receive.

Land ownership is indeed the key question. We thoroughly explain the difference
between Leasehold and Hak Pakai, and verify all contracts for guaranteed
extension rights. This is exactly what we discuss during our video consultation
with actual documents in hand.

The important thing: even if laws change in the future, existing contracts
are protected — this is a fundamental legal principle.

Shall we schedule a 20-minute call to walk through the legal framework?
No commitment — just clarity.
```

## Case 10: High ROI & Installment Plans

**Situation:** Client interested in maximum returns and payment flexibility.

**Goal:** Explain realistic yields, present installment options.

**Script:**
```
Good day, Alex!
Great question about returns. Based on our Estate Market analytics,
realistic yields in Bali range from 12-17% annually at 75%+ occupancy.

Regarding payment flexibility, many developers offer:
• 12-24 month interest-free installments
• Pre-sale entry from $80,000
• Lock-in pricing during construction phase

I can prepare a detailed financial model with three scenarios
(conservative, base, optimistic) for properties matching your criteria.
When would be convenient for a Zoom call — this week or next?
```

---

## Case 11: Market Study & Technical Risks

**Situation:** Client wants to understand market risks, construction quality.

**Goal:** Demonstrate expertise, explain due diligence process.

**Script:**
```
Excellent approach, Alex — understanding risks is crucial.

Our 140-point due diligence protocol covers:
• Developer track record and completed projects
• Legal documentation verification
• Construction quality standards
• Financial model stress testing
• Exit strategy options

Our Head of Sales, Anton Mironenko, personally visits construction sites.
We can also arrange a virtual or in-person site inspection.

Would you like to see our due diligence checklist during a brief Zoom call?
```

---

## Case 12: Fund Transfers & Crypto

**Situation:** Client asks about payment methods, including cryptocurrency.

**Goal:** Explain available options, maintain compliance.

**Script:**
```
Good day, Alex!
We work with various payment methods to accommodate different situations:

• International bank transfers (USD, EUR)
• Cryptocurrency (BTC, ETH, USDT) — available with select developers
• Escrow accounts for added security

Each method has its specifics regarding documentation and timing.
During our consultation, we can discuss which option best suits
your situation and walk through the process step by step.

Shall we schedule a call to discuss the details?
```

---

## Case 13: Residential + Yield

**Situation:** Client wants property for personal use AND rental income.

**Goal:** Explain hybrid models, owner usage periods.

**Script:**
```
Good day, Alex!
This is actually a popular model — combining personal use with rental income.

Many of our properties offer:
• Owner usage periods (typically 30-60 days/year)
• Professional management during rental periods
• Flexible scheduling for your visits

The key is choosing properties with proper management companies
that can handle the transitions seamlessly.

I can show you several options that work well for this hybrid approach
during a quick Zoom call. Would this week work for you?
```

---

## Case 14: Investment Newbie

**Situation:** Client has never invested in real estate, especially abroad.

**Goal:** Educational approach, build confidence, reduce overwhelm.

**Script:**
```
Good day, Alex!
I completely understand — 90% of our clients started exactly where you are now.

Investing abroad can seem overwhelming, but here's how we simplify it:

1. **Education first** — We explain the entire process step by step
2. **140-point audit** — We've already done the due diligence
3. **Legal support** — Full documentation guidance
4. **Management included** — Turnkey rental operation

The meeting format is purely educational — no pressure, no commitment.
Just clarity on whether this makes sense for your situation.

Would 20 minutes this week work to walk through the basics?
```
